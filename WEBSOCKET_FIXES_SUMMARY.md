# WebSocket and Session Management Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Session Management in Lobby Page
**Problem**: Players getting disconnected or ready status not syncing in real-time between users.

**Root Causes**:
- WebSocket room joining wasn't properly handling user session data
- Ready status updates weren't including proper user identification
- Missing fallback mechanisms when WebSocket fails
- WebSocket authentication errors due to missing user information

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `joinRoom()` to include user ID and username in WebSocket events
- Improved `toggleReady()` with better error handling and HTTP API fallback
- Added timeout mechanism for WebSocket operations with automatic fallback
- Enhanced server-side `handlePlayerReady()` to handle user data properly
- Added proper session persistence across reconnections
- Improved WebSocket authentication with better error handling and validation
- Added automatic page refresh for authentication errors

### 2. Room List Not Updating in Dashboard
**Problem**: New rooms not appearing in dashboard without page refresh.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing real-time event listeners for room updates
- Server not emitting proper room update events
- Client-side event handling incomplete

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper WebSocket event listeners for `roomsUpdated` and `roomDeleted`
- Enhanced server-side room creation to emit both `roomCreated` and `roomsUpdated` events
- Added logging for better debugging of WebSocket events
- Improved client-side room list management

### 3. Missing Auto-redirect After Room Creation
**Problem**: Users not automatically redirected to lobby after creating a room.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Modified `handleCreateRoom()` to immediately redirect to lobby page
- Added fallback room creation handling in `handleRoomCreated()`
- Improved user experience with immediate feedback

## Technical Improvements

### Client-Side (Frontend)

#### `src/pages/lobby.js`
- Enhanced `joinRoom()` with proper user data transmission
- Improved `toggleReady()` with timeout and fallback mechanisms
- Added `readyFallbackTimeout` for better error handling
- Enhanced WebSocket event handlers with proper session management

#### `src/pages/dashboard.js`
- Added proper WebSocket event listeners for room updates
- Enhanced room creation flow with auto-redirect
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added `handleRoomDeleted()` for real-time room removal

#### `src/core/SocketManager.js`
- Added logging for WebSocket events for better debugging
- Enhanced event forwarding system

### Server-Side (Backend)

#### `server/websocket/socketManager.js`
- Enhanced `handleJoinGameRoom()` to accept user data from client
- Improved `handlePlayerReady()` with better user identification
- Added proper session management for reconnections
- Enhanced error handling and auto-rejoin functionality

#### `server/routes/rooms.js`
- Added proper event emission for room creation
- Enhanced room update broadcasting
- Added logging for debugging WebSocket events

## Key Features Added

### 1. Robust Session Management
- WebSocket connections now properly maintain user sessions
- Automatic reconnection and room rejoining
- Fallback to HTTP API when WebSocket fails
- Fixed aggressive authentication monitoring that was causing false session expiry alerts

### 2. Real-time Updates
- Room list updates in real-time without refresh
- Player status changes sync across all clients
- Proper event broadcasting for all room operations

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Timeout mechanisms for WebSocket operations
- Automatic fallback to HTTP API
- Proper error messages and user feedback
- Less aggressive session validation to prevent false positives

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Auto-redirect after room creation
- Immediate UI updates for better responsiveness
- Proper loading states and feedback
- Fixed "session expired" alerts appearing incorrectly

### 5. Authentication Improvements
- **Disabled aggressive session monitoring by default** - prevents false "session expired" alerts
- **Non-blocking WebSocket authentication** - dashboard works even if WebSocket auth fails
- **Graceful WebSocket error handling** - no immediate redirects on WebSocket auth errors
- Reduced frequency of session validation checks
- Better handling of network errors during validation
- More robust token expiry checking
- Fixed false session expiry alerts

### 6. WebSocket Connection Fixes
- **Test token support** - server now accepts test tokens in development mode
- **Real JWT token generation** - added `/api/auth/test-token` endpoint for proper JWT tokens
- **Improved token verification** - supports both real JWT and test tokens
- **Connection diagnostics** - comprehensive diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
- **Environment configuration** - proper `.env` setup for development
- **Fallback mechanisms** - graceful degradation when WebSocket fails

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Room Creation Test**:
   - Create a room in dashboard
   - Verify auto-redirect to lobby
   - Check that room appears in other users' dashboards without refresh

2. **Ready Status Test**:
   - Join a room with multiple users
   - Toggle ready status
   - Verify real-time updates across all clients
   - Test with network interruptions

3. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - Join a room
   - Refresh the page or simulate connection loss
   - Verify automatic reconnection and room rejoining

## Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are properly set:
- `JWT_SECRET`: For WebSocket authentication
- WebSocket server configuration in `server.js`

### Client Configuration
- Socket.IO client properly configured with authentication
- Proper error handling and reconnection logic

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Added Logging
- WebSocket connection events
- Room join/leave operations
- Ready status changes
- Error conditions and fallbacks

### Debug Tools
- Browser console logs for client-side debugging
- Server console logs for backend debugging
- Test page for isolated WebSocket testing

## Future Improvements

1. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Add periodic ping/pong for connection health
2. **Advanced Reconnection**: Implement exponential backoff for reconnections
3. **User Presence**: Add user online/offline status indicators
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement event batching for high-traffic scenarios
5. **Security Enhancements**: Add rate limiting and additional validation
