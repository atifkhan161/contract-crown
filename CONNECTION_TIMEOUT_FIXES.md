# WebSocket Connection Timeout Fixes

## Issue Summary

The application was experiencing frequent connection timeout and recovery cycles for WebSocket connections, as evidenced by logs showing:

```
[ConnectionStatus] Connection timeout for ccc (CK7JHVCsvvoWi6W0AAAT)
[ConnectionStatus] Connection recovered for ccc
[ConnectionStatus] Connection timeout for bbb (sb9X5b1xRYnOoLa2AAAV)
[ConnectionStatus] Connection recovered for bbb
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Aggressive Timeout Settings**: The original timeout was set to 30 seconds with heartbeat checks every 10 seconds, which was too aggressive for real-world network conditions.

2. **False Positive Timeouts**: The system was marking connections as timed out even when they were still active but experiencing temporary latency.

3. **Insufficient Recovery Logic**: The recovery mechanism wasn't properly handling edge cases where connections appeared timed out but were actually still functional.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Adjusted Timeout Settings

**File**: `server/websocket/connectionStatus.js`

- Increased connection timeout from 30 seconds to **60 seconds**
- Increased heartbeat interval from 10 seconds to **15 seconds**
- Increased recovery window from 5 seconds to **10 seconds**

```javascript
// Before
this.connectionTimeout = 30000; // 30 seconds
this.heartbeatInterval = 10000; // 10 seconds

// After
this.connectionTimeout = 60000; // 60 seconds
this.heartbeatInterval = 15000; // 15 seconds
```

### 2. Enhanced Connection Validation

**File**: `server/websocket/connectionStatus.js`

- Added double-checking of socket connection status before declaring timeout
- Improved cleanup logic for disconnected sockets
- Enhanced recovery mechanism with better error handling

```javascript
// Check if socket is actually still connected before declaring timeout
if (!socket.connected) {
  console.log(`[ConnectionStatus] Socket actually disconnected for ${socket.username || 'Unknown'} (${socket.id})`);
  return;
}
```

### 3. Improved Client-Side Connection Management

**File**: `client/src/core/ConnectionManager.js`

- Synchronized client timeout settings with server
- Added proper health check ping response handling
- Fixed event listener names to match server events

```javascript
// Synchronized timeouts
this.heartbeatInterval = 15000; // Match server heartbeat interval
this.connectionTimeout = 60000; // Match server timeout

// Added health check response
handleHealthCheckPing(data) {
  if (this.socketManager.socket && this.socketManager.socket.connected) {
    this.socketManager.send('pong-health-check', {
      timestamp: data.timestamp,
      clientTime: Date.now()
    });
  }
}
```

### 4. Connection Diagnostics Tool

**File**: `server/websocket/connectionDiagnostics.js`

- Created comprehensive diagnostics system for monitoring connection health
- Added automated issue detection and recommendations
- Provides detailed reporting for troubleshooting

### 5. Diagnostics API Endpoints

**File**: `server/src/routes/diagnostics.js`

- `/api/diagnostics/connections` - Get full connection diagnostics report
- `/api/diagnostics/connections/user/:userId` - Get user-specific connection stats
- `/api/diagnostics/connections/health-check` - Force health check
- `/api/diagnostics/health` - Basic server health status

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Monitor Connection Logs

Watch for reduced frequency of timeout/recovery cycles:

```bash
# Monitor server logs for connection status messages
tail -f server/logs/app.log | grep "ConnectionStatus"
```

### 2. Use Diagnostics API

```bash
# Get connection diagnostics report
curl http://localhost:3000/api/diagnostics/connections

# Check specific user connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/diagnostics/connections/user/USER_ID

# Force health check
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/diagnostics/connections/health-check
```

### 3. Browser Console Monitoring

Check browser console for connection manager events:

```javascript
// In browser console, monitor connection events
window.connectionManager?.on('connectionChange', (data) => {
  console.log('Connection state changed:', data);
});

window.connectionManager?.on('heartbeat', (data) => {
  console.log('Heartbeat latency:', data.latency + 'ms');
});
```

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:

1. **Reduced Timeout Frequency**: Fewer false positive timeouts
2. **Improved Connection Stability**: More stable WebSocket connections
3. **Better Recovery**: Faster and more reliable connection recovery
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting

## Configuration Options

You can adjust these settings in `server/websocket/connectionStatus.js`:

```javascript
// Connection timeout settings
this.connectionTimeout = 60000; // Adjust based on your network conditions
this.heartbeatInterval = 15000; // Heartbeat frequency
this.maxReconnectAttempts = 5;  // Max reconnection attempts
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Regular Health Checks**: Use the diagnostics API to monitor connection health
2. **Log Analysis**: Monitor connection timeout patterns in server logs
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track connection statistics over time
4. **Network Conditions**: Adjust timeout values based on your deployment environment

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see connection issues:

1. Check network latency between client and server
2. Verify firewall/proxy settings aren't interfering with WebSocket connections
3. Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory)
4. Consider implementing connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
5. Use the diagnostics tool to identify specific connection patterns

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for 24-48 hours to verify the fixes are effective
2. Adjust timeout values if needed based on your specific network conditions
3. Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for connection health
4. Document any additional patterns or issues that emerge
