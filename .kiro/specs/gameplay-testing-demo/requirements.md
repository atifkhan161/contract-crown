# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive testing and validation of the Contract Crown gameplay implementation. The core gameplay features are already implemented but need thorough testing to ensure all game mechanics work correctly according to the PRD specifications. To facilitate easy testing without requiring multiple users, a demo room feature will be implemented that allows single-player testing with AI bots simulating other players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a demo room feature accessible from the dashboard, so that I can test all gameplay features without needing multiple real users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Demo Room" button on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL create a special demo game session
2. WHEN a demo game session is created THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the remaining 3 player slots with AI bots
3. WHEN a user enters a demo room THEN the system SHALL bypass all multiplayer validation requirements
4. IF a user is in a demo room THEN the system SHALL allow the game to start immediately with bots
5. WHEN bots are active in a demo room THEN they SHALL make valid game moves according to Contract Crown rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the complete card dealing mechanism, so that I can verify the 32-card deck generation and distribution works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a demo game starts THEN the system SHALL generate a 32-card deck with cards 7 through Ace in all four suits
2. WHEN cards are dealt THEN the system SHALL deal 4 cards initially to each player for trump declaration
3. WHEN trump is declared THEN the system SHALL deal the remaining 4 cards to each player
4. WHEN dealing is complete THEN each player SHALL have exactly 8 cards
5. WHEN cards are dealt THEN no duplicate cards SHALL exist across all players

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the trump declaration phase, so that I can verify the first player can declare trump and it affects the game state correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial 4 cards are dealt THEN the first player SHALL be prompted to declare trump
2. WHEN trump is declared THEN the system SHALL store the trump suit for the current round
3. WHEN trump is declared THEN the declaring team SHALL be identified and marked
4. WHEN trump is declared THEN all players SHALL be notified of the trump suit
5. WHEN trump declaration is complete THEN the remaining 4 cards SHALL be dealt to all players

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the trick-taking mechanics, so that I can verify card play validation and trick winner determination works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN they SHALL be able to select and play a valid card from their hand
2. WHEN a card is played THEN the system SHALL validate suit-following rules (must follow lead suit if possible)
3. WHEN a player cannot follow suit THEN they SHALL be allowed to play trump or discard
4. WHEN all 4 cards are played in a trick THEN the system SHALL determine the winner correctly (highest trump or highest lead suit)
5. WHEN a trick is won THEN the winner SHALL lead the next trick

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the scoring system, so that I can verify points are calculated correctly based on tricks won.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a round ends THEN the system SHALL count tricks won by each team
2. WHEN the declaring team wins 5 or more tricks THEN they SHALL score the exact number of tricks won
3. WHEN the declaring team wins fewer than 5 tricks THEN they SHALL score 0 points
4. WHEN the challenging team wins 4 or more tricks THEN they SHALL score the exact number of tricks won
5. WHEN the challenging team wins fewer than 4 tricks THEN they SHALL score 0 points

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the Crown Rule implementation, so that I can verify trump declaration privilege passes correctly between rounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the declaring team wins 5 or more tricks THEN the same player SHALL declare trump in the next round
2. WHEN the declaring team wins fewer than 5 tricks THEN trump declaration SHALL pass to the dealer's left
3. WHEN a new round starts THEN the dealer position SHALL rotate clockwise
4. WHEN Crown Rule is applied THEN the correct player SHALL be identified as the first player for trump declaration
5. WHEN multiple rounds are played THEN the Crown Rule SHALL be consistently applied

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test game completion, so that I can verify the game ends correctly when a team reaches 52 points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any team reaches 52 or more points THEN the game SHALL end immediately
2. WHEN the game ends THEN the winning team SHALL be announced
3. WHEN the game ends THEN final scores SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the game ends THEN user statistics SHALL be updated
5. WHEN the game ends THEN players SHALL be able to return to the dashboard

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test real-time synchronization, so that I can verify all game state updates are properly broadcast to all players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game action occurs THEN all players SHALL receive real-time updates
2. WHEN trump is declared THEN all players SHALL see the trump suit update immediately
3. WHEN a card is played THEN all players SHALL see the card appear in the trick area
4. WHEN a trick is won THEN all players SHALL see the trick completion and score updates
5. WHEN the game state changes THEN all UI elements SHALL update consistently across all players

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test error handling and edge cases, so that I can verify the game handles invalid actions and connection issues gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player attempts an invalid move THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN a player tries to play out of turn THEN the action SHALL be rejected
3. WHEN a player tries to play a card they don't have THEN the action SHALL be rejected
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the game SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the game state SHALL remain consistent and recoverable
