# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the existing Contract Crown PWA application to follow the recommended full-stack Express + Vite folder structure as outlined in the fullstack-express-deploy.md document. The current project has a mixed structure where frontend files are at the root level alongside server files, which doesn't provide clear separation of concerns. The restructuring will organize the codebase into distinct client and server directories with proper separation, making the application more maintainable, deployable, and aligned with modern full-stack development best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend code organized in a dedicated client directory, so that I can clearly separate frontend concerns from backend logic and follow modern full-stack project conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a `client/` directory containing all frontend code
2. WHEN frontend files are moved THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing HTML files (index.html, login.html, register.html, dashboard.html) in the client directory
3. WHEN the client structure is created THEN the system SHALL have a `client/src/` directory containing the main.js entry point and organized subdirectories
4. WHEN the client structure is created THEN the system SHALL have `client/src/components/`, `client/src/pages/`, and `client/src/assets/` directories for proper code organization
5. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL move the existing `src/` directory contents to `client/src/`
6. WHEN the client directory is created THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated `client/package.json` with frontend-specific dependencies and scripts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend code properly organized in a server directory structure, so that I can maintain clean separation between different backend concerns and follow Express.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL reorganize the existing `server/` directory to follow the recommended structure
2. WHEN the server structure is updated THEN the system SHALL have `server/src/` as the main source directory
3. WHEN the server source is organized THEN the system SHALL have subdirectories: `server/src/config/`, `server/src/controllers/`, `server/src/routes/`, `server/src/middlewares/`, `server/src/services/`, `server/src/models/`, and `server/src/utils/`
4. WHEN existing server files are moved THEN the system SHALL preserve all current functionality by moving files to appropriate subdirectories
5. WHEN the server structure is complete THEN the system SHALL have `server/src/app.js` for Express app setup and `server/src/server.js` as the HTTP server entry point
6. WHEN the server directory is restructured THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing `server/package.json` with updated scripts if necessary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process and configuration files updated to work with the new folder structure, so that the application continues to build and run correctly after restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the folder structure is changed THEN the system SHALL update `vite.config.js` to work from the client directory
2. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL update the root `package.json` scripts to work with the new structure
3. WHEN build processes are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure the frontend builds to `client/dist/` directory
4. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL update any import paths that reference the old structure
5. WHEN configuration files are moved THEN the system SHALL ensure `manifest.json` and service worker files are properly located
6. WHEN the new structure is in place THEN the system SHALL verify that development and production build processes work correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want static assets and public files properly organized, so that the application serves files correctly and follows the recommended static file serving pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL create a `client/public/` directory for static assets
2. WHEN static files are organized THEN the system SHALL move appropriate static files (manifest.json, service worker, favicon, etc.) to `client/public/`
3. WHEN the public directory is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the Express server can serve built frontend assets from the correct location
4. WHEN static file serving is configured THEN the system SHALL update server configuration to serve static files from the build output directory
5. WHEN asset organization is complete THEN the system SHALL move CSS, images, and other assets to appropriate locations within the client structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the testing and development tooling to work with the new folder structure, so that I can continue to run tests, use development servers, and maintain code quality after restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the folder structure changes THEN the system SHALL update Cypress configuration to work with the new structure
2. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure both client and server tests continue to work
3. WHEN development tooling is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure the concurrent development server setup continues to function
4. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL update any file paths in test files and configuration
5. WHEN tooling is verified THEN the system SHALL ensure linting, testing, and build processes work from the new structure
6. WHEN development workflow is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that hot module replacement and proxy configuration work correctly
