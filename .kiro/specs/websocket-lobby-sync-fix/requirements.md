# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical websocket synchronization issues in the multiplayer lobby system where real-time updates are failing, causing disconnects between the API layer and websocket state management. The system currently suffers from inconsistent state between the database, websocket manager, and frontend, leading to broken lobby functionality including ready status updates, team formation, and game start capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Ready Status Synchronization

**User Story:** As a player in a lobby room, I want my ready status changes to be immediately visible to all other players in real-time, so that the lobby can function properly for coordinating game starts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks the ready button THEN all other players in the room SHALL see the status change within 1 second
2. WHEN a player's ready status changes THEN the websocket state SHALL be immediately synchronized with the database state
3. WHEN a ready status update fails via websocket THEN the system SHALL fallback to HTTP API and retry websocket synchronization
4. WHEN all connected players are ready THEN the host SHALL see the start game button become enabled in real-time

### Requirement 2: Websocket-Database State Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the websocket state manager to maintain perfect synchronization with the database, so that there are no disconnects between API operations and real-time updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player joins via HTTP API THEN the websocket room state SHALL be immediately updated to reflect the new player
2. WHEN a player's data is updated in the database THEN the websocket state SHALL be automatically synchronized within 500ms
3. WHEN there is a state mismatch detected THEN the system SHALL automatically reconcile by fetching the authoritative database state
4. WHEN websocket connections are lost THEN player reconnection SHALL restore the correct synchronized state from the database

### Requirement 3: Team Formation Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a host player, I want team formation to work reliably and show real-time updates to all players, so that we can organize teams before starting the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the host clicks "Form Teams" THEN all players SHALL see their team assignments update in real-time
2. WHEN teams are formed THEN the websocket state SHALL immediately reflect the team assignments for all connected players
3. WHEN team formation occurs THEN the database SHALL be updated and websocket state SHALL remain synchronized
4. WHEN a player disconnects after team formation THEN their team assignment SHALL persist and be restored on reconnection

### Requirement 4: Game Start Functionality Fix

**User Story:** As a host player, I want the start game functionality to work correctly when all players are ready and connected, so that we can begin playing the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all connected players are ready AND teams are formed (for 4-player games) THEN the start game button SHALL be enabled
2. WHEN the host clicks start game THEN all players SHALL receive the game starting event and be redirected to the game page
3. WHEN the game start process begins THEN the room status SHALL be updated in both database and websocket state
4. WHEN there are exactly 2 connected ready players THEN the game SHALL be startable without team formation

### Requirement 5: Connection Status Accuracy

**User Story:** As a player in a lobby, I want to see accurate connection status for all players in real-time, so that I know who is actually available to play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player connects to the lobby THEN their connection status SHALL be immediately visible to all other players
2. WHEN a player disconnects THEN their status SHALL update to "disconnected" for all other players within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a player reconnects THEN their status SHALL update to "connected" and their previous ready state SHALL be restored
4. WHEN calculating ready counts THEN only connected players SHALL be included in the count

### Requirement 6: Websocket Event Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all websocket events to be delivered reliably with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the lobby system remains functional even during network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a websocket event fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL attempt retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
2. WHEN websocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt reconnection and state resynchronization
3. WHEN websocket events are missed due to disconnection THEN the system SHALL fetch the current state from the API upon reconnection
4. WHEN critical events (ready status, team formation, game start) fail THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback and alternative actions

### Requirement 7: JWT Authentication and User ID Consistency

**User Story:** As a system, I want to ensure that the user ID from JWT tokens matches the database user ID consistently across all websocket connections and API operations, so that authentication is reliable and secure throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a websocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL validate that the JWT token user ID matches an existing user ID in the database
2. WHEN a user performs any lobby action THEN the system SHALL verify the JWT user ID against the database user record before processing the action
3. WHEN there is a mismatch between JWT user ID and database user ID THEN the system SHALL reject the connection and return an authentication error
4. WHEN validating user identity THEN the same user ID validation logic SHALL be used consistently across websocket connections, HTTP API endpoints, and database operations
5. WHEN a user reconnects THEN the system SHALL re-validate the JWT user ID against the database to ensure continued authentication integrity

### Requirement 8: State Reconciliation System

**User Story:** As a system, I want automatic state reconciliation between websocket and database layers, so that inconsistencies are detected and resolved without user intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically reconcile using the database as the source of truth
2. WHEN a player performs an action THEN the system SHALL validate the action against both websocket and database state
3. WHEN reconciliation occurs THEN all affected players SHALL receive updated state information
4. WHEN multiple state updates occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them atomically to prevent race conditions
