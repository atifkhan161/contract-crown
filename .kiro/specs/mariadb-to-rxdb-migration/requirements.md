# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Contract Crown application from MariaDB to RxDB with LokiJS storage adapter running on the Node.js server. This migration will maintain the server-side database architecture while leveraging RxDB's reactive capabilities and real-time synchronization features. The migration will enable better real-time data synchronization, reactive updates, and improved performance through RxDB's optimized query system and built-in replication capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use RxDB with LokiJS storage on the Node.js server so that I can leverage reactive database capabilities while maintaining server-side data control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN RxDB SHALL initialize with LokiJS storage adapter successfully
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use RxDB's reactive query system
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN all data SHALL persist through LokiJS file-based storage
4. WHEN multiple server instances are needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with proper data synchronization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want real-time updates without page refreshes so that I can see game state changes immediately as they happen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another player makes a move THEN my game interface SHALL update automatically without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN game state changes occur THEN all connected players SHALL receive updates within 100ms
3. WHEN multiple players perform actions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain data consistency across all clients so that all players see the same game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conflicts occur between local and remote data THEN the system SHALL resolve them using predefined conflict resolution strategies
2. WHEN a player joins a game THEN they SHALL receive the complete current game state
3. WHEN data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and notify users of sync issues


### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game data to persist reliably so that I don't lose progress due to server issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server experiences unexpected shutdown THEN game progress SHALL be preserved through LokiJS persistence
2. WHEN the server restarts THEN all game sessions SHALL be restored to their previous state
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide backup mechanisms to prevent data loss

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to maintain backward compatibility during the migration so that existing users are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is deployed THEN existing user accounts SHALL continue to work without requiring re-registration
2. WHEN the migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL support both database systems temporarily
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all historical game data SHALL be preserved and accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new database system to support the existing game features so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all current game features SHALL work identically to the MariaDB implementation
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support the same authentication mechanisms
3. WHEN games are created and managed THEN all existing game management features SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want improved performance and responsiveness so that the game feels more fluid and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading game data THEN the application SHALL display data faster than the current MariaDB implementation
2. WHEN performing game actions THEN the response time SHALL be under 50ms for local operations
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the initial load time SHALL be reduced compared to the current implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and recovery mechanisms so that data loss is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery or provide manual recovery tools
3. WHEN synchronization errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and provide user-friendly error messages
