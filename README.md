## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- VS Code (recommended for development with included debugging configuration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd contract-crown-pwa
```

2. Install root dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env with your configuration
```

**Note**: During the folder structure refactoring, the client will have its own `package.json` with frontend-specific dependencies. Currently, frontend dependencies are managed at the root level.

### Development

Start both frontend and backend in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs:
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:5173` (served from client/ directory)
- Backend API server on `http://localhost:3030`

### Application Pages
- **Login**: `http://localhost:5173/login.html` - User authentication
- **Register**: `http://localhost:5173/register.html` - New user registration  
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard.html` - Main game dashboard
- **Lobby**: `http://localhost:5173/lobby.html` - Waiting lobby for game preparation (currently at root level)
- **Home**: `http://localhost:5173/` - Landing page

**Note**: Some pages are currently being served from the root level during the transition to the new folder structure.

### Individual Services

Start only the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

Start only the backend:
```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

### WebSocket Development and Testing

The project includes comprehensive WebSocket testing tools for development and debugging:

**Enhanced User Data Compatibility**: The WebSocket system now provides consistent handling of both `user_id` and `id` field names in user objects and JWT tokens, ensuring seamless compatibility across different authentication systems and user data structures. This includes proper current user identification in the lobby interface.

**Flexible User ID Handling**: The entire application now supports both `user_id` and `id` field names in user objects across all operations including host transfer, ready status handling, player management, current user identification, and room ownership validation, providing robust compatibility with different authentication backends and user data structures.

#### Quick Start WebSocket Fix
For immediate WebSocket connection resolution, see `QUICK_START_WEBSOCKET.md` for a **3-step fix**:

1. **Environment Setup** (30 seconds): Verify your `server/.env` configuration
2. **Test Connection** (1 minute): Run `node diagnose-websocket.js` for automated testing
3. **Verify in Browser** (1 minute): Use `test-websocket-connection-fixed.html` for interactive testing

#### Comprehensive Fix Guide
For detailed troubleshooting, follow the **Complete Fix Guide** in `fix-websocket-connection.md`:

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure `.env` with proper JWT settings
2. **Test Connection**: Use interactive test pages or diagnostic tools
3. **Common Issues**: Solutions for authentication, token, and connection problems
4. **Manual Token Creation**: Fallback token generation for testing
5. **Verification**: Confirm dashboard and lobby functionality

#### Interactive WebSocket Testing Tools
Access these browser-based testing interfaces during development:

- **`test-websocket-connection-fixed.html`**: Complete WebSocket connection testing with authentication setup
- **`test-websocket-fixes.html`**: Room management and ready status testing
- **`test-auth-debug.html`**: Authentication state debugging and token validation
- **`test-dashboard-auth.html`**: Dashboard-specific authentication testing
- **`test-auth-simple.html`**: Basic authentication testing and token management

These tools provide:
- **Real-time Connection Testing**: Test WebSocket connections with authentication
- **Room Management Testing**: Create, join, and leave rooms interactively
- **Ready Status Testing**: Toggle player ready status and observe real-time updates
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all WebSocket events with timestamps
- **Connection Status Monitoring**: Visual connection status indicators
- **Error Handling Testing**: Test various error scenarios and edge cases
- **Token Generation**: Multiple methods for creating valid authentication tokens

#### Running the WebSocket Client Example
```bash
cd server
node examples/websocket-client-example.js
```

This command-line example demonstrates:
- **Multi-client Simulation**: Creates 4 simulated players to test multiplayer functionality
- **Complete Game Flow**: Simulates joining rooms, ready status, game start, trump declaration, and card play
- **Connection Management**: Tests authentication, reconnection, and error handling
- **Real-time Events**: Demonstrates all WebSocket events used in the game
- **Development Testing**: Perfect for automated testing of WebSocket functionality

#### WebSocket Client Usage
The example client can also be imported and used in other testing scenarios:

```javascript
import ContractCrownWebSocketClient from './server/examples/websocket-client-example.js';

const client = new ContractCrownWebSocketClient('http://localhost:3030');
await client.connect('user-123', 'TestPlayer', 'test@example.com');
client.joinGameRoom('game-456');
client.setReady('game-456', true);
```

#### WebSocket Diagnostic Tools
For comprehensive WebSocket troubleshooting and validation:

**Automated Diagnostic Tool**:
```bash
node diagnose-websocket.js
```

This diagnostic tool provides:
- **Environment Validation**: Checks JWT configuration and environment variables
- **Token Generation Testing**: Validates JWT token creation and verification
- **Connection Testing**: Tests WebSocket connection establishment and authentication
- **Room Operations Testing**: Validates room joining, ready status, and event handling
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed diagnostic reports with recommendations

**WebSocket Fixes Validation**:
```bash
node validate-websocket-fixes.js
```

This validation script checks:
- **Code Implementation**: Verifies that all required WebSocket fixes are present in the codebase
- **File Existence**: Ensures all necessary files and components are in place
- **Feature Completeness**: Validates that lobby functionality, ready status handling, and connection management are properly implemented
- **Documentation**: Confirms that test files and documentation are available

The script provides detailed feedback on:
- ✅ Successfully implemented features
- ❌ Missing or incomplete implementations
- 📋 Next steps for testing and validation

### Troubleshooting

#### Quick WebSocket Fix
If experiencing WebSocket connection issues, see the comprehensive troubleshooting guides:
```bash
# View the 3-step quick fix guide (fastest solution)
cat QUICK_START_WEBSOCKET.md

# View the detailed fix guide (comprehensive troubleshooting)
cat fix-websocket-connection.md

# Run automated diagnostics
node diagnose-websocket.js

# Validate all fixes are in place
node validate-websocket-fixes.js
```

#### Common Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running (your server runs on port 3030)
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health

# Test JWT token generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/api/auth/test-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser"}'

# Run full diagnostic
node diagnose-websocket.js

# Check server logs
npm start | grep -E "(WebSocket|Socket|Auth)"
```

#### Expected Behavior After Fix
✅ Dashboard shows "Connected" status (not "Disconnected")  
✅ Room creation works and auto-redirects to lobby  
✅ Lobby ready status syncs in real-time between users  
✅ No more "Authentication failed" popups
