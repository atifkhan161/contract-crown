# Full Stack Express + Vite (Vanilla JS) App: Project Structure & Docker Deployment

This document is your comprehensive blueprint for developing and shipping a maintainable, performant full-stack app built with Express.js (Node.js) as the backend, and a Vite-powered vanilla JS frontend—deployable as a unified Docker container, including for Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64).

---

## 1. Recommended Folder Structure

Organize your repo with clear separation of front end and back end, plus a zone for shared code (if needed).

```

my-fullstack-app/
├── client/               \# Vite frontend (Vanilla JS)
│   ├── public/           \# Static files (favicon, robots.txt)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── assets/       \# Handled by Vite
│   │   ├── components/   \# Reusable UI widgets
│   │   ├── pages/        \# Page/module organization
│   │   └── main.js       \# Entry point

│   │   ├── app.js        \# Express app setup
│   │   └── server.js     \# HTTP server entry
│   └── package.json
├── shared/               \# Optional: code/libraries for both tiers
│   └── package.json
├── Dockerfile            \# For building \& running app in a container
├── package.json          \# Root scripts (use workspaces if desired)
└── README.md             \# Project doc

```

> **Best Practice:**  
> - Build the frontend (`client/`) to a static `dist/` directory.
> - Move/copy build artifacts to the backend's `public` (or `dist/public`) directory.
> - Serve static files with Express in production.

---

## 2. Express + Vite Integration: Dev and Prod

**Development:**
- Use [vite-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-express) for a one-command DX (optional; simplifies API + HMR in dev).
- Alternatively, run both servers (Express & Vite) concurrently and proxy frontend calls to `/api`.

**Production:**
- Build Vite frontend: contents land in `client/dist/`
- Express backend uses: `express.static()` to serve frontend assets

---

## 3. Docker Deployment: Single Container (Raspberry Pi 4 Compatible)

### Dockerfile

```


# 1. Use official ARM64 Node.js for Raspberry Pi

FROM --platform=linux/arm64/v8 node:20-alpine as base

WORKDIR /app

# 2. Copy root manifest \& install dependencies (adjust for any monorepo tools)

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# 3. Copy all code

COPY . .

# 4. Frontend: Build Vite app

WORKDIR /app/client
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# 5. Move frontend dist to backend's public dir

WORKDIR /app
RUN mkdir -p server/dist/public \&\& cp -r client/dist/* server/dist/public/

# 6. Backend: Install dependencies

WORKDIR /app/server
RUN npm install

# TypeScript users: add `RUN npm run build` as needed

# 7. Run server

WORKDIR /app/server
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]

```

---

### Building & Running the Container

1. **On Pi 4 or x86_64 host with buildx**  
   *(Cross-building is preferred for heavy projects; see Docker buildx docs.)*

    ```
    docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t my-fullstack-app:latest .
    ```

2. **Run the Container**

    ```
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name fullstack-app my-fullstack-app:latest
    ```

   - Access your site via `http://<raspberrypi-ip>:3000`

---

### Environment Variables

- Use a `.env` file in `server/` or pass variables with `-e VAR=value` in `docker run`
- Don't bake secrets into your Docker image

---

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Solution                                                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ARM64/Platform Errors   | Ensure `FROM --platform=linux/arm64/v8 node:...` in Dockerfile |
| Slow Build on Pi        | Build on a PC (with buildx) and transfer image to Pi        |
| Port Already in Use     | Change `EXPOSE`/`-p` or stop conflicting process            |
| Out of Memory           | Build on a device with more RAM or add swap on Pi           |

## 5. Summary & Checklist

- [x] Use a modular, monorepo-style structure for client and server code
- [x] Serve built static frontend via Express with `express.static`
- [x] Use one Dockerfile to build for ARM (Raspberry Pi + cloud ARM hosts)
- [x] Pass secrets/configs as runtime env variables, not baked into image
